# Image-Classification-cifar10
This project implements a simple image classification system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras. It utilizes the CIFAR-10 dataset for training and testing, enabling the model to classify images into one of the ten classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, or truck.
