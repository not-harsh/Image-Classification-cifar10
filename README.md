# Image-Classification-cifar10
This project implements a simple image classification system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras. It utilizes the CIFAR-10 dataset for training and testing, enabling the model to classify images into one of the ten classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, or truck.

Key Features:

Loads and preprocesses the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Constructs a CNN model for image classification.
Integrates the model into a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.
Allows users to browse and classify images using the trained model.
Usage:

Clone or download the repository.
Install the required dependencies (tensorflow, matplotlib, numpy, tkinter, PIL).
Run the image_classification_gui.py script to launch the GUI.
Browse and select an image to classify using the CNN model.
Note: Ensure you have a compatible Python environment set up to run the code.
